# Krita - SVG -> Merge, Save.
Takes all vectors layers in your document, merges them and allows you to save the now merged vector layer as a SVG.

Less clicks while working with SVGs in Krita.

Work non-destructively when working with vector content in Krita, without the workflow overhead of flattening and exporting every time you need an SVG version.


TODO:

- Move Export button bellow other export buttons.
