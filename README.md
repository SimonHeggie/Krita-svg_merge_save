# SVG -> Merge, Save.
Scripting technology to solve the lack of support for multi-layer SVG file handling in Krita
Focus for now is merging SVGs, and working towards combining that with a save/export.


TODO:

- Move Export button bellow other export buttons.
- Disabled UNDO step usage during script excecution.
